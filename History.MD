Meron's workflow requires access to PURE API, which we did not manage to obtain. Additionally, the information received needs to be slightly updated - we are not necessairly looking at the amount of keywords in articles, but more towards percentages of data/code sharing for a particular list of articles.

* Example paper which cites code repository in the references: https://scipost.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.16.5.135 /  10.21468/SciPostPhys.16.5.135 + example 2: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.075416

However: Not all researchers cite their data/code in the references - most will only mention a link or DOI to a dataset/repository. 

* Example paper which has a data availability statement: https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202300258

Journals such as Soft Matter and PHYSICAL REVIEW B do not have these standardised 'data availability statement' or they call it differently (data and material availability statement). 

Possibly both approaches combined would give the most information: checking the references (and checking the authors of the references in case the authors are citing someone elses data/code), and checking the text for data availability statements or keywords (zenodo, 4TU.ResearchData).

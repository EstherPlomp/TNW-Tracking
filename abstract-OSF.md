## Tracking Research Objects: Levelling the playing field in research assessment

_Authors/Session Leads: Esther Plomp, ..._

Including Open Science practices in the evaluation of researcher performance is currently a contested subject within academia. 
Although many researchers contribute to their field of expertise in a multitude of manners, the most stringent criteria of success is the number of research articles published. 
Subverting the current “publish or perish” culture requires a novel approach to the evaluation of research objects (such as software, data and methods) other than research articles. 
However, there is currently no standardised way to track such research objects. 
This session aims to provide a space to discuss our needs and requirements regarding the tracking of research objects, providing space for questions such as: 
Should we track research objects or has this the risk to reinforce the publish or perish culture?
Are there any examples in the Netherlands where tracking of research objects have been successful? 
Can tracking of research objects incentivise researchers to share their research outputs in accordance with the FAIR principles, or do we need other tools? 
What technological infrastructure would be needed to effectively track research objects - Are there existing tools that can be adapted for this purpose? 
How can we balance quantitative and qualitative metrics in the evaluation of research objects? 
How can tracking research objects promote equity and inclusion within the research community? 
Please bring your examples, recommended practices and questions (and answers!) to the session!
